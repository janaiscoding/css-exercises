As a general idea, I think I understood the basis of Flexbox. 
I find it quite complicated at certain times. 
For example: 
1. how does it turn from rows to columns and reversed when there's just a flex-direction specified 
2. grouping certain divs together to make the whole flexbox make sense 
3. spacing sometimes is weird 

Well, mostly 1 is really weird cus it's unclear to me when I should be justifying and aligning.
However, I am hopeful that I will understand. 
All I have to do is... keep learning :D
